# Your proprietary folder

This folder should contain all proprietary files of your project.
Files in this folder are not part of Surikata.io and therfore are not licensed
under Surikata.io's license.

Your proprietary *Plugins* and *Themes* must be stored here.

Alos, often it can be a composer's vendor folder for 3rd pary libs that you will
use in your proprietary plugins. If this folder contains a vendor/autoload.php,
this will be included by ROOT/Init.php.
